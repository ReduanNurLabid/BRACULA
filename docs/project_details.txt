# BRACULA - BRAC University Community Platform

## Project Overview

BRACULA is a comprehensive web-based community platform designed specifically for BRAC University students. The platform facilitates social interaction, resource sharing, campus engagement, and coordination of various student activities through a unified interface.

## System Architecture

BRACULA employs a custom MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture implemented in PHP:

- **Models**: Encapsulate business logic and data persistence
- **Views**: HTML templates with embedded PHP for dynamic content rendering
- **Controllers**: API endpoints that handle HTTP requests and orchestrate data flow

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: PHP 7.4+
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- **Server**: Apache (via XAMPP)
- **Authentication**: Custom JWT-based authentication system

## Core Features

### User Management
- **Registration & Authentication**: Email-based registration with secure password handling
- **Profile Management**: Edit personal information, profile pictures, and privacy settings
- **Activity Tracking**: Monitor user engagement across the platform

### Post Management
- **Create/Edit/Delete Posts**: Full CRUD operations for user-generated content
- **Content Categories**: Organize posts by communities and topics
- **Voting System**: Upvote/downvote functionality for content curation
- **Save Posts**: Bookmark functionality for later reference

### Social Interaction
- **Comments**: Comment on posts with support for rich text
- **Nested Comments**: Reply to existing comments with unlimited nesting
- **Notifications**: Real-time notification system for interactions

### Resource Sharing
- **Material Upload/Download**: Share academic resources and materials
- **Content Categorization**: Organize materials by course, subject, or type

### Event Management
- **Event Creation**: Create and publish campus events
- **Registration**: RSVP functionality for event attendance
- **Calendar Integration**: View events in calendar format

### Ride Sharing
- **Ride Offers**: Post available rides for carpooling
- **Ride Requests**: Request rides from other community members
- **Driver Reviews**: Rate and review drivers for quality assurance

### Accommodation
- **Listing Management**: Post and manage accommodation listings
- **Inquiries**: Send and respond to accommodation inquiries
- **Filtering**: Search accommodations by criteria (price, location, etc.)

## MVC Implementation Details

### Models
The system includes well-defined model classes for each domain entity:
- **User.php**: User account management and authentication
- **Post.php**: Content creation and management
- **Comment.php**: Discussion thread management
- **Event.php**: Campus event coordination
- **Ride.php**: Ride sharing functionality
- **Accommodation.php**: Housing and accommodation listings

### Controllers (API Endpoints)
Controllers are implemented as PHP files in the API directory, handling:
- Request validation and sanitization
- Business logic orchestration
- Database interactions via models
- Response formatting and error handling

### Views
Views are implemented as HTML templates with embedded PHP, following a clean separation of concerns:
- Presentation logic isolated from business logic
- Consistent styling through centralized CSS
- Client-side interactivity via JavaScript

## Database Schema

The database design follows relational principles with proper foreign key constraints between:
- Users and their content (posts, comments)
- Posts and associated comments
- Events and registrations
- Ride offers and requests
- Accommodations and inquiries

## Security Measures

- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation of all user inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Prepared statements for database queries
- **XSS Protection**: Output escaping for user-generated content
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based protection for form submissions
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with proper timeout

## Future Enhancements

- Implementation of a formal router for improved URL handling
- Enhanced authentication with multi-factor options
- Integration with university SSO systems
- API documentation using Swagger
- Potential migration to a lightweight PHP framework
- Mobile application development for improved accessibility

## Development and Deployment

- **Development Environment**: XAMPP for local development
- **Version Control**: Git for source code management
- **Testing**: PHP unit tests for core functionality
- **Deployment**: Apache server configuration for production

This comprehensive platform provides BRAC University students with a centralized hub for community engagement, academic collaboration, and campus resource sharing in a user-friendly, secure environment.
